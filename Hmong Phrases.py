# Some Linguistics Notes of Intrigue

# Dabtsi and abtsi are identical in meaning.  However dab means demon/evil spirit,
# so you are slanting your wording/question to indicate something negative, troublesome,
# or naughty should you say dabtsi instead of abtsi.  The Hmong can be very superstitious, so
# please use care and thoughtfulness around elders in how you use this seemingly small nuance.
# When talking to children, you are insinuating they are being a cheeky troublemaker, which
# is more or less innocent- particularly if its clear you are teasing them.

# Puas is a functional word that transforms any phrase/action into a question.

# Hmong does not has a discrete Yes / No in the language.  You either affirm or negate the
# verb or action using mas as suffix to the verb or using tsis as prefix to the verb.
# Yog mas is an all around general affirmation and is the closest phrase to Yes, though it
# colloquially translates into something more like "that's correct".
